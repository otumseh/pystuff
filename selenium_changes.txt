Warning: find_element_by_* commands are deprecated. Please use find_element() instead
...implies that the find_element_by_* commands are deprecated in the latest Selenium Python libraries.

As @AutomatedTester mentions: This DeprecationWarning was the reflection of the changes made with respect to the decision to simplify the APIs across the languages and this does that.

Solution
Instead you have to use find_element(). As an example:

You have to include the following imports

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
Using class_name:

button = driver.find_element_by_class_name("quiz_button")
Needs be replaced with:

button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "quiz_button")
In similar lines you also have to change the following:

Using id:

element = find_element_by_id("element_id")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "element_id")
Using name:

element = find_element_by_name("element_name")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "element_name")
Using link_text:

element = find_element_by_link_text("element_link_text")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "element_link_text")
Using partial_link_text:

element = find_element_by_partial_link_text("element_partial_link_text")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, "element_partial_link_text")
Using tag_name:

element = find_element_by_tag_name("element_tag_name")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "element_tag_name")
Using css_selector:

element = find_element_by_css_selector("element_css_selector")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "element_css_selector")
Using xpath:

element = find_element_by_xpath("element_xpath")
Needs be replaced with:

element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "element_xpath")
Note: If you are searching and replacing to implement the above changes, you will need to do the same thing for find_elements_*, i.e. the plural forms of find_element_*.
